# HackerRank Projects of David Kroell

This is the repository for all the projects that I conduct on the website <b>www.hackerrank.com</b>

Info
====
All of the projects on here are projects that are under certain categories, such as Cryptography, and others, which are challenges the web-developers put online.

Each folder is a category above, the following construct works like this:

```
                       |Categories|
                             |
                             |
                   _________ V__________
                  |          |          |
                  V          V          V
           |Projects|    |Projects|   |Projects| 
           
      //And moving into specific code for those projects.
      
```
